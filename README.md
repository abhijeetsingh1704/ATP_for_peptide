# ATP_for_peptide
This programs calculates the approximate energy (ATP) required to form a peptide chain

This program gives an approximate estimation of the amount of ATP require to form a peptide chain of any length. It basically consider the ATP consumed or formed in the formation of individual amino acid precursor and calculate the net gain of ATP in the total amino acid precursors formation and calculate the energy required for the creation of peptide bonds between the amino acid residues.
